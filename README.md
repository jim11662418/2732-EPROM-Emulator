# EPROM-Emulator
The IDT7134 Dual Port RAM connects through a ribbon cable to the 2732 EPROM socket on my home-brew 4004 single board computer to act as as EPROM emulator. Plug the ribbon cable from the EPROM Emulator into the 4004 SBC 2732 EPROM socket. Download an Intel Hex file into the Dual Port RAM through the serial port on the Emulator's AT89S52 MCU. Press the SBC's reset switch. The 4004 fetches its instructions from the Dual Port RAM. The firmware for the AT89S52 MCU was assembled using the Telemark Assembler by Squak Valley Software.
